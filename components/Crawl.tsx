            It is a period of performance war. Plone developers, striking from a
            hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Pagespeed
            Enforcement Empire.

          <p>
            During the battle, Plone developers managed to steal secret plans to
            the Empire’s ultimate performance weapon, the Lighthouse, an
            armoured space station with enough power to destroy an entire
            website and all the development work.

          <p>
            Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Plone developers raced home

            stolen plans that can save their people and restore freedom to the
            galaxy....
